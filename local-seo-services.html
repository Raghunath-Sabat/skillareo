				<h5>1. Understanding Goal.</h5>
				<p>Being a growth expert digital marketing agency, we know that understanding your main digital Goal is very crucial for the success of your business. Once we have identified your goal we can translate those goals into measurable and achievable results. In short we understand your goal and make them a sweet reality.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
				<h5>2. SWOT Analysis.</h5>
				<p>We adopt SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.) Analysis to assess your organization's current position before any other strategy and find out what's working best for your business and what's not so good and make the most of what you've got. With the help of SWOT analysis, We'll reduce the chances of your failure, by understanding what you're lacking or missing, and wipe out the threat that will try to damage your business growth in any way.</p>
				</li>

        <li>
        <h5>3. Local SEO Strategic Planning.</h5>
        <p>Every business should have a local SEO strategy if they don’t want to ignore high-intent qualified leads. This is exclusively crucial for local businesses who need to target people in their local area. When done correctly, local SEO can help you achieve more high-quality traffic, leads, and conversions. Along with that, it can also help you compete with big brands and stay relevant in the competition. Skillareo will help you create a comprehensive and profitable local SEO strategy with the help of our dedicated local SEO professionals to gain better results in today’s local search landscape.</p>
        </li>

				<li>
				<h5>4. Site Audit, Analysis & Usability Test.</h5>
				<p>An extraordinary local SEO campaign starts with a comprehensive website audit. If you want to drive more organic traffic to your site and improve your search engine rankings, you need to conduct website audits regularly. A website audit is truly the first step in any effective and successful local SEO campaign. Local search users are motivated and targeted. If you can attract them, you’ll see a rise in your conversions. We'll plan an effective local SEO audit that helps you uncover what’s wrong with a site or page and what areas you need to tackle first.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>5. Local Competitive Analysis.</h5>
				<p>A thorough competitive analysis can be transformed into your blueprint of what you need to do to improve your site to be as good as your competitors. It can also be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of both your site and your competitor's sites. By utilizing this information, you can discover the areas you are weak that you can improve upon them, as well as identifying the areas where your competitors are weak, and then make the most of their weaknesses for your site and search performance.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>6. GEO-Keyword Research.</h5>
				<p>Keyword research is an essential part of Local SEO, as it allows you to make sure that you’re focusing your time and energy on search terms that people are actually using or searching. Local SEO can be time-consuming, so We don’t want to spend months of hard work getting to position #1 on Google for a keyword that nobody is searching for. Without knowing which keywords are worth targeting you’re missing out on the opportunity to benefit from local searchers who are looking to act now.</p>
				</li>

        <li>
          <h5>7. GMB Optimization & Management.</h5>
        <p>Google’s algorithm for ranking Business Profiles does not just consider proximity and relevance. It's also considered the activity and quality of information. Optimizing your Google My Business Profile sends these signals to Google to rank you higher in local results. And higher rank leads to more visibility and engagement with your business.</p>
        </li>

				<li>
					<h5>8. On-Page Optimization.</h5>
				<p>From UI to UX our dedicated website development team will make hundreds of changes both big and small to your website and creates a tactical plan to fix all the issues and warnings and helping you increase the usability, accessibility, speed, and functionality of your website. Our team will review technical SEO issues on a regular basis to ensure we are always having a positive impact on organic search performance.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>9. Off-Page Optimization.</h5>
				<p>Off-page SEO or optimization is a crucial part of getting your site in front of your target audience. Our dedicated Local SEO specialist team will create new opportunities for website growth by helping your brand build local links (and relationships) with trusted experts in your industry. By auditing your site’s backlink profile and performing competitor backlink-gap analysis, our team will initiate extensible outreach campaigns to score new links across the web.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>10. Measure.</h5>
				<p>The goal of every organization is to earn or increase revenue. Getting relevant, qualified search traffic to your website is just the beginning of our Local SEO strategy. By measuring short-term objectives and ROI (Return On Investment), we can improve the chances of achieving your goals.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>11. Testing/Optimization.</h5>
				<p>We believe in optimizing and testing everything and making continual improvements to your SEO marketing strategy. If you're spending hundreds, thousands, or even millions of rupees a month on marketing, you better be able to spend it as efficiently as possible. The more you test/optimize your product/services before you produce and sell them, the more likely you are to earn the sales and profits that you desire.</p>
				</li>

        <li>
          <h5>12. Reporting.</h5>
        <p>We'll always keep you updated with what we are doing, how everything is working, why we are doing it and provide you data and insights every week with full transparency. When things are going well, we will share why and when performance is down, we don’t sugarcoat our conclusions. We will constantly provide recommendations on how to right the ship.</p>
